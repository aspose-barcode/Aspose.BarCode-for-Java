### **Generate Barcode in Java Console Application**
Sometimes, developers want to generate barcode images at the back end programmatically. This requirement can be because of they:

- need to generate barcode images and then save to database,
- have to store barcode images to some other location after creating them at runtime, or
- want to integrate barcode generation feature to some other application.

There can be plenty of other reasons for working with barcodes at the back end which depend upon the developer's requirements.

[Aspose.BarCode](https://www.aspose.com/products/barcode/java) provides the [BarcodeGenerator](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/barcode/com.aspose.barcode.generation/BarcodeGenerator) class which creates barcodes. Developers can create an instance of this class, set properties and save the barcode image to any location.
#### **Java**

The resulting output barcode image generated by the code above can be seen below.

### **Generate Barcode in Java Swing application**
Follow the steps below to use Aspose.BarCode in Java Swing applications:
\1. Design your swing application as shown in the figure below using your choice of GUI tool. For example, Netbeans or Eclipse.

\2. [Apply a license](/barcode/java/licensing/) (if applicable) to the control to avoid the evaluation watermark in the barcode image. The code that applies the license can be added to the constructor or some custom initialization method of the form.

\3. Add the code to the project:
#### **Java**
{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "9dea2dd38be50330a824dd05da062a97" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-barcode-examples-ApplyALicense-ApplyALicense.java" >}}

\4. On the button event handler method, write the following code to generate the barcode image and save it to disk. And later on, use the Graphics object to render the image on the frame.
#### **Java**
{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "9dea2dd38be50330a824dd05da062a97" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-barcode-examples-barcode_image-rendering_features-RenderBarcodeToGraphicsObject-.java" >}}

\5. Now run the application. You should get output similar to the screenshot below.
