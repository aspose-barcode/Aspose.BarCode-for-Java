Unlike one-dimensional barcodes, two-dimensional barcodes often contain a huge amount of data, which is exactly why two-dimensional barcode exists. We often print out the human-readable code text along with the barcode. The code text has nothing to do with machine scanning but is purely aimed at human readers. For two-dimensional barcodes, the code text is too long to display. There are two ways of dealing with the code text: hide it, or reduce the font size.
