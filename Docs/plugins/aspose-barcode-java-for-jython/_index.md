## **Introduction**
### **What is Jython?**
Jython is a Java implementation of Python that combines expressive power with clarity. Jython is freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use and is distributed with source code. Jython is complementary to Java and is especially suited for the following tasks:

- **Embedded scripting** - Java programmers can add the Jython libraries to their system to allow end users to write simple or complicated scripts that add functionality to the application.
- **Interactive experimentation** - Jython provides an interactive interpreter that can be used to interact with Java packages or with running Java applications. This allows programmers to experiment and debug any Java system using Jython.
- **Rapid application development** - Python programs are typically 2-10X shorter than the equivalent Java program. This translates directly to increased programmer productivity. The seamless interaction between Python and Java allows developers to freely mix the two languages both during development and in shipping products.Â 
### **Aspose.BarCode for Java**
Aspose.BarCode for Java is a robust and reliable barcode generation and recognition component, written in Java, it allows developers to quickly and easily add barcode generation and recognition functionality to their Java applications.

Aspose.BarCode for Java supports the Java SE, Java EE and Java ME platforms.
### **Aspose.BarCode Java for Jython**
Project Aspose.BarCode for Jython shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.BarCode Java APIs in Jython. This project is aimed to provide useful examples for Jython Developers who want to utilize Aspose.BarCode for Java in their Jython Projects using [Jython](http://www.jython.org/).

### **Using**
You can create 2D BarCode using following example code:

{{< highlight java >}}

 from asposebarcode import Settings

from com.aspose.barcode import BarCodeBuilder

from com.aspose.barcode import Symbology

class Creating2DBarCode:

    def __init__(self):

        dataDir = Settings.dataDir + 'WorkingWith2DBarCodes/Basic2DBarCodeFeatures/Creating2DBarCode'

        # Instantiate barcode object

        builder =  BarCodeBuilder()

        symbology= Symbology

        builder.setSymbologyType(symbology.Pdf417)

        # Width of each module

        builder.setxDimension(0.6)

        # Height of each module

        builder.setyDimension(1.2)

        builder.setCodeText("this is some test code text. \n Second line \n third line.")

        # Save the image to your system and set its image format to Jpeg

        builder.save(dataDir + "Creating2DBarCode.jpg")

        # Display Status

        print "Created 2D BarCode Successfully."

if __name__ == '__main__':

    Creating2DBarCode()
