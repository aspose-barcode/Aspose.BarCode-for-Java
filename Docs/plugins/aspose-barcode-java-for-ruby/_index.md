## **Introduction**
### **Rjb - Ruby Java Bridge**
RJB is a bridge program that connect between Ruby and Java with Java Native Interface. Rake + Rjb is the more powerful and useful build tool than both Maven and Ant. You can test your Java business logic class itself with Rjb's mock. It helps to migrate Struts's Model Object into your RoR application. But beware to buildSwing application, Ruby (and Rjb) doesn't consider JVM's native threads handling.
### **Aspose.Barcode for Java**
Aspose.BarCode for Java is a robust and reliable barcode generation and recognition component, written in Java, it allows developers to quickly and easily add barcode generation and recognition functionality to their Java applications.
